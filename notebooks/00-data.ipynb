Essentially, they collected a number of data files from the website above. For each audio file, the segmented the track into notes and then extracted 120 MFCCs for each note. The goal is to recognize the instrument from the 120 MFCCs. The process of feature extraction is quite involved. So, we will just use their processed data."
